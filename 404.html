            Oops! Looks like you've entered a page that hasn't been created yet. Or maybe you just mistook the address
            and wrote an extra letter, it happens to everyone. Either way, you can always <a class="link" href="/">go
              back to the main page</a> and continue using the project.

            However, if you see this window when trying to access an existing section of the site, or this is not the
            first time this error has occurred, try <a class="link"
              href="https://github.com/KonaloboStudio/konalobostudio.github.io/issues">create a ticket</a> to help find
            the bug.
